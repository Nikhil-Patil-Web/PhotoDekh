# PhotoDekh
The following is a project I have done for working on my development skills. It is a photosharing app similar to the very well known Facebook. The stack used is MERN. 


The project involves searching and finding the intricate svgs that have been used in facebook. 
I have encorporated Cloudinary to deal with the storage of pictures. 
Here is a brief overview of the project:

Tech Stack Used: 
1) MongoDB, as the database.
2) Express JS for implementing the routing.
3) React JS for implementing the front end templates along with the SVGS.
4) Node JS for writing the backend for controllers and even for Authentication.

Details of Authentication:
1) Very Basic JWT Authentication can be easily implemented.
2) CSS styling is implemented to make the frontend exactly same as the very well known Facebook.

Different Packages USed:
React Spinners were used as loaders. 
Emoji Pickers were used as input.
Cloudinary was encorporated for dealing with the storage of emojis.
